# Flywheel Engine
`Flywheel` is an open-source, cross-platform 2.5D game engine built on `SDL3`.
It is lightweight, dependency-free, and includes `Serde` support for easy
serialization. Designed for performance and flexibility, `Flywheel` simplifies
game development while leveraging `SDL3`'s power for smooth rendering and input
handling.
